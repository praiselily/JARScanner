# JARScanner
This application locates javaw instances in prefetch and determines loaded mods via index. 

Files are hashed and checked against modrinth API and then investigated if unknown. Detections include:
- String searching
- Determining packaging
- Obfuscated classes
- Manifests
- File modifications
- Hardlinks

Run the application as an admin, or import it through powershell for less hassle.
